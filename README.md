## Plugin features
- [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) support
- Rotate, scale, and move STL models.
- Slice multiple STLs at a time. Split 1 STL into unconnected parts.
- Circular print bed support (do you have a delta printer?).
- High-light overhang areas. Automatically orient the model for better result ("lay flat").
- Slice based on PrusaSlicer profiles you upload to OctoPrint.
- Customizable slicer settings, including Basic (layer height, bed temperature ...) and Advanced (print speed, start/end G-code ...).

and many many others for all of the support, building the original plugins, and OctoPrint!
I'm standing on the shoulders of giants and doubt I would've been able to start this project without the exsisting code and infrastructure.
